# louisville-rental
This application can tell you if a listed property is eligible for AirBNB rental and estimates profit


1. Zillow API - new house listed in louisville (other sites: trulia, redfin)
2. Louisville Open Data (can I put an Airbnb on it)
-Zoning map (what is the property zoned as)
-Conditional Use Permits or effected by one
